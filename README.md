# Nomster

This is an app where food enthusiasts can post information about various restaurants and shops they have visited. Users can also upload photos and post comments (including ratings). A public dashboard is available for each user to showcase their involvement. 

The application was built on a Ruby on Rails framework. The information is saved to a PostgreSQL database. Devise is used for user authentication. The Geocoder API displays Google Maps when a correct street address is entered. SendGrid helps with notifying a user via email when someone else leaves a comment for the restaurant they have shared information on.
